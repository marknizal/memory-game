# 🧠 Memory Game

Memory Game is a web-based matching game built with modern frontend tech. The goal is simple: flip cards / tiles two at a time, try to find matching pairs. If you pick a pair that matches, they stay revealed. If they don’t match, they flip back. The challenge is remembering where the matching cards are among the face-down ones. It’s often timed (or counts moves), giving both a fun and mental workout testing short-term memory, concentration, and pattern recognition.
